# Lung_Cancer_Prediction

## Motivation and Idea
As we all know, Lung cancer is one of the leading cancer diseases causing people to die worldwide. There are many reasons for which patients are diagnosed with lung cancer. Most of these are human-made such as smoking, air pollution, dust allergy, lack of a balanced diet, and obesity. 
It is really hard to help patients recover from lung cancer due to finding out late about the disease. If we can find out about the disease in its early stages, it can be much easier to treat those patients. Many factors can lead to lung cancer in the human body eventually likewise their age, gender, genetics, air pollution exposure, alcohol use, dust allergy, occupational hazards, genetic risk, chronic lung disease, balanced diet, obesity, smoking, passive smoking, chest pain, coughing of blood, fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, wheezing, swallowing difficulty, clubbing of finger nails and snoring.
Me and my teammate will build a machine learning model by analyzing those early factors so that we can predict which person will more likely have lung cancer if not treated well. We will use the dataset that we found in a study from over 462000 people in China who were followed for an average of six years. We will use some classification methods based on our dataset like Linear Support Vector Classification, and K Neighbors Classifier, to further analyze the dataset and provide a machine learning model.

## Methodology
The Applied Project will be based on a dataset of Lung Cancer Prediction on Kaggle, analyzed using the Python programming language. The project is a team effort of Sowrav Roy Joy (100878102) and Shaulin Ali (100927397)  and will be submitted at the end of Winter Term 2024, with delivery in the form of a project report.
